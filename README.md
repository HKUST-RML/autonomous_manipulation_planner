# autonomous_manipulation_planner
This is a novel framework, which is to autonomously generate a manipulation plan to accomplish various complex tasks requiring dexterity, without requiring an expert to manually design a control strategy for a particular task in an ad-hoc manner.

The input includes a description of the environment, the initial finger position, shape and desnsity distribution of the object, the initial and target object poses, gripper to use, friction coefficient.

Here are four examples:

Task1: pick an object off the flat ground with a passive gripper featuring zero mobility. Please run task1.py.

Task2: place an object onto the flat ground with a passive gripper feturing zero mobility. Please run task2.py.

Task3: Scoop an object out of a hole. Please run task3.py.

Task4: Insert an object into a hole. Please run task4.py.
